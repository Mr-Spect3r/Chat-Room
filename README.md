# Chat Room

A simple but secure app for chatting with friends or groups

# Setup


- To set it up, just upload the server.py file into an rdp/vps/host and run it (change the password and port in the file first).

- Then you and your friends can connect to the server with the client file.

- If you want to create a chat room network without the server, you must use ngrok or the server and client must be connected to the same wifi network
